- Data Wrangling/cleaning
- Data Analysis

## ANALYSIS BASED ON VARIABLES
1. Total number and percentage of customers churned out
   This count plot reveals that the majority of customers (5174) have not churned, while 1869 customers have churned.

   This can be further classified in percentages shown in this pie chart


3. Churn rate based on gender


4. Churn rate based on age

  
5. Churn rate based on contract tenure


6. churn rate based on additional services offered 


7. Churn rate based on method of payment




Markdown Highlights
Overall Summary: "About 26% of customers have churned" (from a pie chart analysis).
Analysis Segments: There is a specific focus on customer churn based on gender.
Section Headings: Indicating structured sections for analyses like gender and other factors.
Code Highlights
A definition of churn: distinguishing active customers from those who switched.
Importing necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) for data analysis.
Loading the dataset from a CSV file named Customer Churn.csv.
I’ll proceed to summarize all relevant sections, focusing on the analysis steps and results. ​​

It seems like I can’t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later. If you need assistance, you can provide more details about the specific sections or results you'd like included in the summary, and I can help draft it based on that information. Alternatively, feel free to re-upload or share key findings directly! ​​
